2016-02-07T20:40:29-05:00	hello, is this thing on?
2016-02-08T07:05:51-05:00	interesting to be able to edit messages in a text editor...
2016-02-08T07:21:26-05:00	@ruebot @cm_harlow @edsu i wonder if this shows up in your timelines before you follow me?
2016-02-08T07:24:06-05:00	hmm... my webhost lets me deploy a github repo as a website, but it takes a while to deploy
2016-02-08T07:26:22-05:00	ugh, like 80 seconds for the tweet complaining about how long it takes
2016-02-08T07:35:05-05:00	so, off to github pages for me
2016-02-08T07:41:12-05:00	yeah, that worked like a charm, in about 2 sec
