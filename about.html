<h1>about</h1>

<p>i never planned to be a software developer. i was enchanted by the internet since i first saw it in '92 and had been tinkering around with linux since i first installed it on my white-box 386 a couple years later. but when i graduated from college, i wanted to work in publishing and maybe be a writer when i could figure out what i wanted to say. but when that didn't work out, i took a job doing graphic design, miscellaneous office work, and answering phones at a small technology company. then i became the "computer guy" after the previous computer guy left (true story, he was literally named Guy).</p>

<p>after a couple years of that, i got my first library job, working on a grant-funded online medical records project. i learned some perl to write a campus map application because i needed to give someone directions to visit me, not knowing that the library ran the campus website and would give me a job as a developer a year later. my first big project was writing an electronic resources database (that wound up also being a kind of primitive CMS).</p>

<p>i started working from home part time in 2001 when my daughter was born, and then
full time when we moved to england for my wife's postdoc. to make that work, i
worked on the union catalog of art images project, building a union catalog of art
metadata. it wasn't until i moved to florida that i started working on repositories,
first rewriting our home-grown rdf/xml repository, then adapting it to implement the
fedora 3 rest api with a hydra frontend.</p>

<p>when the fedora 4 project started up, i started working on that â€” ultimately
spending several years working on a project that never worked out for my previous or
current employers.</p>
